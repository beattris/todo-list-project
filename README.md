# Easy Task - A task management app.

![Home view of Easy Task](./src/assets/easy%20task.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is a refresher course project. It is a task management app that allows one to view and assign task to different users. During this course project, I reinforced my knowledge of major ng concepts like Components, Databinding, Directives, Services & dependency injection, Routing, Observables, Forms, Pipes, and much more! I also implemented some of the newer angular features, like **signals**!
